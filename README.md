# Personal-Training
I am working on my Personal Training license while also am an Amateur Body Builder. I have worked with a register dietitian and other PTs to help refine 
my code to provide information that is both feasible and practical for those interested in utilizing them. As I get more involved, I will create more scripts
that will include more options and different factors of fitness

List of Current Scripts and their description

1. Macros.py - used to calculate your protein, carb, and fat intake over a specified time given your goals and current physique. Please note this assumes that you are staying at a certain level of activity and if you change that, your macros will change as well. This does not factor in the TYPE of workouts done (HITT, strength training, cardio, etc) but may factor that it down the line.
2. TBD
